# Weight-and-Balance

## Calculating Aircraft Weight and Balance

- Find Your Aircraft's Empty Weight and Moment.
- Find Weights of Everything Loaded.
- Calculate the Moment for the Load.
- Total Up the Weights and the Moments.
- Determine If Center of Gravity Is Within Limits.

*Standard empty weight* — The weight of the airframe, engines, and permanently installed fixtures and fluids (including unusable fuel and full engine oil)

*Basic empty weight* — Standard empty weight plus any accessories your airplane might have added

*Maximum ramp weight* — The total weight of a loaded aircraft including all fuel. It is greater than the takeoff weight due to the fuel that will be burned during the taxi and run-up operations.

*Maximum takeoff weight* — Maximum weight you can take off with.

*Maximum landing weight* — Maximum weight you can land with.

*Maximum zero fuel weight* — The loaded aircraft weight with everything except fuel. 

*Arm* — The horizontal distance in inches from the reference datum line to the CG of an item. The algebraic sign is plus (+) if measured aft of the datum and minus (–) if measured forward of the datum.

*Datum* — A reference point chosen by the manufacturer from which all arms are measured. 

*CG* — The center of gravity measured in inches aft of the datum.

*Moment* — The product of the weight of an item multiplied by its arm. Moments are expressed in pound-inches (in-lb). Total moment is the weight of the airplane multiplied by the distance between the datum and the CG.

*Moment index* — Moments are usually long numbers, so many POH/AFMs index them to simplify the math. This simply means they divide them by either 100 or 1,000. So 123,456.0 in-lbs becomes 1,234.56 or 123.456. 

### Formulas

`Moments = Weight x Arm`

`CG = Moments/Weight`
